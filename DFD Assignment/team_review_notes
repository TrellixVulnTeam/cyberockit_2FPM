-	You may want to change the name of the trust boundary that is in front
     of the Application Provider from “Unknown Developer” to “App Store Boundary”.
     While “unknown developer” is accurate with the background knowledge of your 
     use case, it is a bit ambiguous.

-	Drawing needs to be done in MTMT per Dr. G’s requirements
-	Change “Add-ons example VLC” to “Optional Applications”, Add-ons is a 
     bit ambiguous for the entity.
-	For the “Memory” data flow, is this just the part of the a running HA 
     optional application that is currently running in memory? You may want 
     to make the name more defined.

-	You’ll want to change the name of the data flow that connects the User to HA.
     “Secure Access” is a noun phrase but adding “log-in” to it would help clarify
     what action it is that the user is doing to HA.

-	Im not sure if “1.0 Home Assistant” and “1.1 Update Profile Credentials” are 
     running in different memory parts at execution. If they are not, then they 
     could be in the same Process bubble. 
-	I do think that your trust boundaries are correct for the user and the MFA 
     database. I know you voiced concern about that previously. I do not believe
     you need one for the Transaction Database as that database is just acting 
     as a repository for the transactions, not being checked against like the 
     MFA Database is.

     I may be wrong but the database block looks different from the regular database
     items in the lecture, which usually have a two horizontal lines but no vertical 
     lines. Boundary is also misspelled in your trust boundary.

     You might be able to expand the data flow for 'invalid credentials', maybe I am 
     incorrect but the data actually being sent may not be the credentials themselves
     but rather a flag value or something else. Again not sure on that but it may not
     actually send over the invalid credentials

     You might be able to add another trust boundary between the user and the HA app,
     and it looks like the database block is different than in lecture. The ones in 
     the lecture only have two horizontal lines and no vertical lines. You might be 
     able to reword your trust boundary for the developer boundary to something like
     'External Development/Developer Boundary'.

     You might look at changing both data flows called 'data information' to more 
     descriptive data flows. You have one labeled for a data request and one for a 
     data response. Describing what data is responding from the database and what
     data is requesting in the Add-ons might help. Let me know if you'd like me to 
     finalize your diagram on TMT once you make changes since you don't have access.

- You may think about using another boundary that  separates the databases of linked IOT 
- Identify any human involvement if it is available according to your context

Meg
- Process 1.1 seems a bit confusing
- Why invalid data is sent for update?
- I think you used misuse case scenarios for the diagram but I feel a use case scenario will show the normal interactions and its problems after analysis better

Noah
- User sends Secure Access is not a valid name for data flow
- If user already a verified user no boundary is required in that case

Jay
- Change the name of the Add-On thing
- Trust boundary with the Add-On thing may be required
- Should use remote commands as user inputs and a notification of successful command should be sent back to the user

Dylan
- You may add trust boundary between database and HA core.
- You may check the appropriate symbol used to define storage(database).

Meg
- As Dylan mentioned if 1.0 and 1.1 process are at same location they can be in single bubble.
- If both are at different location, you may change data flow 'update confirmation' to 'updated credentials'. Also, 'invalid credentials' may not be sent for update profile credentials.

Noah
- I am not sure if configuration.yaml can be a storage or not.
- Why do you have IoT rest API as the other process? and if it is other process you may need to number it.
- I think process should not be oval in shape. Though I am not sure as I have not accessed TMT yet.

Shifat
- I guess if download is requested to HA the response should be related to download. Correct me if I am wrong.
- I was not able to understand unknown developer as a name of trust boundary.
- Few elements are highlighted darkly.
- Application database has different symbol.
