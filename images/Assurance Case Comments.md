Add comments here for each other's assurance cases.
**Dylan's Comments**

 1. Jay's Assurance Case - 
   For Rebuttal R3, by a "secure IP" do you mean the connection to the IP is secure?
    Sub-Claim C5 is also a little vague, how does the "secure application" give remote access? I see in Evidence E1 that      DuckDNS is used, but how does that relate to a secure remote access?
    I would change the wording on Sub-Claim C6 to "HA prevents brute force attacks with ...". While this is a complete noun-phase it feels like it needs to be a litte  more explained.
    Great job on the Assurance Case!
    
 2. Meg's Assurance Case - 
    Need to remove the string from Inference Rule IR1 down, as it is from Dr. G's original sample.
    Rebuttal R3 has a conjunction in it. Remove the "and expiration time is too long" and make a new Rebuttal. This is the  same for Sub-Claim C6.
    Sub-Claim C5 also has a conjunction in it. Remove "and validates against response manipulation" and either fork the line or remove it. 
    All three undermines have the same UM number (UM1)
    I dont know if you need to include all three undermines as the evidence they are undermining is already hard-coded into HA. Since all of them have the same answer and final evidence, the ends of the strings look redundant. 
    This is a very well thought out assurance case! Good job!
    
 3. Noah's Assurance Case - (comments are for V5)
    In Sub-Claim C9 take out "should", it adds ambiguity and is informal. The evidence is given below it to show that this is not an ambiguous statement.
    In Sub-Claim C5 take out "and" and replace with "or". The current wording sounds like both threshold and settings have to be changed in order to notify the user, when you go on to show that it is either threshold or the settings.
    Great job on the progressions of the assurance cases, and on the part 2 stuff. 
    
 4. Shifat's Assurance Case -
    For Top-Claim C1 take out "mostly free" and replace with "minimize". Current wording is too informal.
    In Sub-Claim C4 take out "mostly". It is too informal, and is ambiguous. You supply evidence after the claim to show that it is not ambiguous. 
    Sub-Claim C3 needs to be branched out to two or three different Sub-Claims. With three conjections separating three points in the claim, each point needs to have its own claim. The Evidence supporting each claim can be the same, but branching them out is what Dr.G stated he wanted.
    Great job on the case so far! The line of reasoning is sound, the graph just needs a few struncture tweeks.
